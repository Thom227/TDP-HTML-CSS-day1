        <h1>First big header</h1>
        <div>Hello to my webpage.</div>
        <div>This should be <b>BOLD</b><u><i>Italics</i></u><b>AND</b><i><u>Underlined</u></i></div>
        <h3> Smaller nicer header</h3>
        <p>With A little paragraph. If only I knew more words that made sense that could go here making it look like more of a paragraph. Oh well this will do.</p>
